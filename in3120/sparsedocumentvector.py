class SparseDocumentVector:
    """
    A simple representation of a sparse document vector. The vector space has one dimension
    per vocabulary term, and our representation only explicitly stores the dimensions that
    have non-zero values. The dimensions that have zero-values are implicit, i.e., they are
    not explicitly represented. For very high-dimensional spaces, such a sparse representation
    typically incurs significant savings wrt both memory usage and computational efficiency.

    For example, a sparse representation of document A might be {"foo": 0.8, "bar": 0.5, "baz": 0.5}
    and a sparse representation of document B might be {"foo": 0.1, "qux": 0.5}. In a space
    spanned by the vocabulary ["foo", "sap", "bar", "baz", "qux", "pum", "pop"], these sparse
    representations would be equivalent to the dense representations [0.8, 0, 0.5, 0.5, 0, 0, 0]
    and [0.1, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0], respectively. Now, imagine the savings incurred for the tiny
    documents A and B if the vocabulary had contained millions of terms.

    Being able to place text buffers, be they documents or queries, in a vector space and
    thinking of them as point clouds (or, equivalently, as vectors from the origin) enables us
    to numerically assess how similar they are according to some suitable metric. Cosine
    similarity (the inner product of the vectors normalized by their lengths) is a very
    common metric.
